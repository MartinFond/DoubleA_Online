# DoubleA_Online
Projet programmation rÃ©seau pour le JV




Command to start the API:
docker-compose up --build

Command to initialize the API database:
Bash:
./init.sh
PowerShell
.\init.ps1

The server and clients needs to run on the same machine

To connect players
player 1: 
     username: example
     password: password123
palyer 2:
     username: example2
     password: password123



Connected players can try to find a match.
The matchmaking waits for 2 players to be in the same bucket and for a server to host the game.
When you start the server, it is added to the matchmaking system of the API.
Whenever 2 player and a server are ready to start, the game launch. (server can be started before or after the clients are added to matchmaking).

The achievement button prints the achievements list of the player, by default there are no achievements.
A DGS can add an achievement to a player (see below).
